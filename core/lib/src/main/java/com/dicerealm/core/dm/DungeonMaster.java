			- When at least half of the party wants to move to a new location, you must set this to the new location's id.
		
			4. contextSummary
			- A string summarizing the current context of the room and adding it to the previous context summary 
			- Include as much infomation as possbile.
			- This summary will be provided back to you in the next turn.

			5. switchToCombatThisTurn

			- Set this to true if any player chooses to fight an enemy.
