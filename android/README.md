# Android Application

This is the Android application for the project. The application is written in Java and uses the Android SDK.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Android application, you need to have Android Studio installed on your machine. You can download Android Studio from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Before running the Android application, ensure that the `lib` is built. You may refer to [lib/README.md](../lib/README.md) for instructions on how to build the library.

To ensure that all gradle dependencies are installed, go to `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files` in Android Studio.
